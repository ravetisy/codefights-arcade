"""Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a
palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and
backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does
not need to be limited to just dictionary words. EXAMPLE

Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat'; "atc o etaÂ·; etc.)

A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards and backwards. Therefore,
to decide if a string is a permutation of a palindrome, we need to know if
it can be written such that it's the same forwards and backwards. What does
it take to be able to write a set of characters the same way forwards and
backwards? We need to have an even number of almost all characters, so that
half can be on one side and half can be on the other side. At most one
character (the middle character) can have an odd count.

    # there is one special case, when the string length is odd, in that
    # case only one character have to be odd(1) and that should be the middle
    # character.

    # the whitespace can affect the string count, and in result the login
    # written in the code.
